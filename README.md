# Basic-Duo-ShinyApp
Very basic R Shiny application using Duolingo language data from a study by Settle and Meeder (2016).

B. Settles and B. Meeder. 2016. A Trainable Spaced Repetition Model for Language Learning. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1848-1858.

This app is for some simple practice with Shiny, around layout. 

The git repository for this study is:

The data was downloaded originally from a sa gzip file containing a csv:

There is a really nice overview of analysis done with the data here:
